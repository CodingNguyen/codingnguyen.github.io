                Hello! I am a Senior <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> student minoring in <strong>Math</strong> at Texas A&M University.
                I originally went into college intending to become a doctor, so I began my time at A&M studying premed Biology. However, I soon realized my true interests were in electronics.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy coming up with creative design solutions for problems, and I have a passion for coding, making, and tinkering. I&#39;ve accumulated about five Raspberry Pis so far for a variety of personal projects.
                Outside of engineering, I enjoy illustrating to express my creative side and playing soccer for a team-oriented outlet.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe I&#39;d make a great asset to any team. I don&#39;t know where I&#39;ll end up, but I know I would like to make a difference and maybe learn a thing or two along the way.
            </p>
